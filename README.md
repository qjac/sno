WordPress Custom theme —MCTC WEBI 2000 Final Project
Built: Spring 2016

Custom WordPress theme created by Jacqueline Quintanilla
aka 'My Little First Theme'

Based on Sheridan Neighborhood Organization, an existing non-profit (including the content, images, and branding). Only the theme is my own.

WEBI 2000 Nonprofit Project Requirements
The nonprofit project must meet the following requirements:
1. The subject must be a redesign or a fictional nonprofit
2. The nonprofit must have listings saved as posts
3. Start the design process with a moodboard
4. High fidelity mockups using Photoshop/Illustrator
5. Use the Skeleton CSS framework for the custom theme.
6. Site must include the following pages:
  a. Contact Us with web form
  b. About Us
  
Personal Goals
- make as much of the site content updateable through the CMS (aka avoid hard-coding content in) 
- use production ready code and techniques as much as possible for my skill level (built in spring 2016): SCSS, responsive, probably some other things that I've forgotten in the intervening year.
